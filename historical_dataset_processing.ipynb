        "Overview\n",
        "--------\n",
        "This script builds a precise, geometry-aware pipeline to detect which client\n",
        "locations may be affected by historical disaster events reported by GDACS.\n",
        "Instead of relying on coarse bounding boxes, it fetches and unifies per-episode\n",
        "polygons from the GDACS API, buffers them if requested, and computes the exact\n",
        "shortest distance from each client point to each disaster geometry. Results are\n",
        "exported to both JSON (summary + matches) and a multi-sheet Excel workbook for\n",
        "analysis and reporting.\n",
        "\n",
        "Typical Use Cases\n",
        "-----------------\n",
        "- Quantify which client sites fell within X km of historical disasters.\n",
        "- Produce decision-ready spreadsheets and JSON summaries for risk reviews.\n",
        "- Merge multiple GDACS GeoJSON files and de-duplicate events by ID.\n",
        "- Convert merged GeoJSON to a flat CSV for quick inspection.\n",
        "\n",
        "Key Inputs\n",
        "----------\n",
        "1) Client CSV (required)\n",
        "   - A table of client/vendor/facility locations.\n",
        "   - Expected columns (case-insensitive; extra columns are OK):\n",
        "     - id, name, address, country, type, latitude, longitude\n",
        "     - latitude and longitude must be numeric (WGS84).\n",
        "\n",
        "2) GDACS GeoJSON (required)\n",
        "   - A merged GeoJSON of disaster events (features list) with rich `properties`,\n",
        "     including `eventid`, `eventtype`, `name`, `description`, `fromdate`,\n",
        "     `todate`, `alertlevel`, and `url.details`.\n",
        "   - The script can help you:\n",
        "       • merge many *.geojson/*.json files: `merge_geojson_files(...)`\n",
        "       • auto-discover & merge by pattern: `auto_merge_json_files(...)`\n",
        "       • remove duplicate events by a key (default `eventid`)\n",
        "\n",
        "Core Workflow (What the Script Does)\n",
        "------------------------------------\n",
        "1) Data Prep\n",
        "   - Optionally merge multiple GDACS GeoJSON files and drop duplicates.\n",
        "   - (Optional) Convert merged GeoJSON to CSV for a flat preview.\n",
        "\n",
        "2) Geometry Enrichment (per disaster event)\n",
        "   - Use `properties.url.details` to fetch the event’s episode list.\n",
        "   - For each episode, call the GDACS polygons API to retrieve geometries.\n",
        "   - Validate and fix geometries if needed; unify (union) all episode shapes\n",
        "     into one “event geometry.” Optionally apply a buffer (km → degrees).\n",
        "\n",
        "3) Proximity Analysis (per client point)\n",
        "   - Compute the shortest distance from the client’s (lon, lat) to the unified\n",
        "     event geometry. If the point lies inside the polygon, distance = 0.\n",
        "   - Keep matches within a user-defined threshold (e.g., 50, 100, 200 km).\n",
        "\n",
        "4) Reporting & Export\n",
        "   - JSON: overall stats + geometry summary + full match records.\n",
        "   - Excel: a comprehensive workbook with multiple analysis sheets, including:\n",
        "       • Matches (row-level results with client + disaster context)\n",
        "       • Summary_Statistics (totals, uniques, distance stats)\n",
        "       • Disaster_Types (counts + percentages)\n",
        "       • Alert_Levels (counts + percentages)\n",
        "       • Countries_Affected (client-country perspective)\n",
        "       • Distance_Analysis (0–10, 10–50, 50–100, 100–200, >200 km bins)\n",
        "       • All_Disaster_Events (complete GDACS properties per event)\n",
        "       • Geometry_Summary (event-level geometry metadata)\n",

        "- Optional CSV from GeoJSON: user-specified name (e.g., merged_data.csv)\n",
        "\n",
        "Distance & Buffer Notes\n",
        "-----------------------\n",
        "- Distances are computed using Shapely geometry distances converted from\n",
        "  degrees to kilometers with the factor ≈ 111.32 km/degree. This is a practical,\n",
        "  widely used approximation. For very large distances or near the poles, consider\n",
        "  swapping in a true geodesic approach if you need higher fidelity.\n",
        "- Buffering uses the same conversion (km → degrees) before applying\n",
        "  `geometry.buffer(...)`.\n",
        "\n",
        "Dependencies\n",
        "------------\n",
        "- Python 3.9+\n",
        "- Packages: pandas, numpy, shapely, requests, openpyxl\n",
        "  Install example: `pip install pandas numpy shapely requests openpyxl`\n",
        "\n",
        "Runtime & Environment\n",
        "---------------------\n",
        "- Internet access is required to call GDACS APIs when constructing geometries.\n",
        "- Works in local Python and Google Colab; Colab file-upload helpers are included.\n",
        "- A geometry cache prevents refetching for the same event during a run.\n",
        "\n",
        "Typical Usage\n",
        "-------------\n",
        "A) Quick run with saved files:\n",
        "   1) Prepare: a client CSV + a merged GDACS GeoJSON.\n",
        "   2) Call:    `results, cache = quick_enhanced_analysis('/path/clients.csv',\n",
        "                                                         '/path/merged_geojson.json')`\n",
        "   3) Choose a maximum distance (e.g., 100 km) and an optional buffer (e.g., 10 km).\n",
        "   4) Save JSON/Excel when prompted.\n",
        "\n",
        "B) Interactive (helpful in Colab):\n",
        "   1) Run `main_enhanced()`\n",
        "   2) Follow prompts to pick files, set distances, and export artifacts.\n",
        "\n",
        "Error Handling & Validation\n",
        "---------------------------\n",
        "- Invalid polygons are repaired with `buffer(0)` when possible.\n",
        "- Episode fetch failures fall back to the current episode ID.\n",
        "- Client coordinate parsing is guarded; malformed rows are skipped with a warning.\n",
        "- If required columns are missing, the script reports a clear message and aborts.\n",
        "\n",
        "Assumptions & Limitations\n",
        "-------------------------\n",
        "- Client CSV must include valid latitude/longitude.\n",
        "- GDACS GeoJSON must include the properties needed to discover details/episodes.\n",
        "- Distance conversion uses a fixed km/degree factor; use geodesic libraries if\n",
        "  you require sub-kilometer accuracy at high latitudes or over large spans.\n",
        "\n",
        "License & Attribution\n",
        "---------------------\n",
        "This script consumes publicly available GDACS data/APIs. Please respect their\n",
        "usage guidelines and attribute GDACS in downstream analyses or reports.\n",
